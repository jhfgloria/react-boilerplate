# react-boilerplate
This is my personal boilerplate for React applications. 🚀

I try to use the latest versions of the npm libs included in it (_but sometimes I'm not able to keep it updated_).

### Available npm commands:
- Start development environment: `npm run start`
- Build and bundle application: `npm run build`

### Libraries installed:
- webpack for bundling 📦
- webpack-dev-server for development runtime 🚀
- babel for ES5+ translation 🈶

I try to start new projects from scratch from this boilerplate, so I try to be completely unopinionated regarding the npm ecosystem: no direct dependencies are installed apart from react and the ones mentioned above. **This means there is no test libraries installed!** If you use this boilerplate don't forget to install your favorite tests library.

Feel free to use it! 

Hope you enjoyed it ❤️
